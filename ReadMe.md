## Summary of Texas Hold'em Poker

Texas Hold'em is a popular version of the card game poker that can be played between 2 to 10 players. The goal of the game is to win chips by either having the best hand or by making all other players fold.

1. **The Setup**: Each player is dealt two private cards (known as "hole cards") that belong to them alone. Five community cards are dealt face-up on the "board".

2. **The Play**: There are four rounds of betting - once after the hole cards are dealt, and then three rounds as the community cards are revealed one-by-one. The community cards are dealt in stages: "the flop" (first three cards), "the turn" (fourth card), and "the river" (fifth and final card).

3. **Betting**: Players bet in clockwise order, and may check, bet, or fold during each round. If a player bets, the players following them must either 'call' (match the bet), 'raise' (increase the bet), or 'fold' (quit for that round).

4. **Hand Rankings**: The player with the best poker hand (or the last remaining player after all others have folded) wins the pot. The standard poker hand rankings apply, with a Royal Flush being the highest possible hand, followed by a Straight Flush, Four of a Kind, Full House, Flush, Straight, Three of a Kind, Two Pair, One Pair, and High Card being the lowest.

5. **Blinds**: In order to stimulate betting, two players are usually required to post small and big blinds before the hand starts. The players required to post these blinds rotates each hand.

6. **Showdown**: If two or more players are left after the final betting round, a showdown occurs, where the remaining players show their cards. The player with the best hand, or the last player remaining after all others have folded, wins the pot.

It's a game that combines chance with strategy, as players must assess the likelihood that their hand is the best, based on the information available.
